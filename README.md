This game is inspired by the old arcade game, "Asteroids" where you can control your ship and shoot lasers in order to destroy all the asteroids. 
there are three types of asteroids. We start off with the bog asteroids which split into two medium sized asteroids upon hitting which each split into two more small asteroids each upon getting hit.
In order for me to make this game i have watched a many youtube videos on how to make some parts of this game, the logic behind them and have asked google for the thrusters design for the spaceship. 
I have also added the sound effects to certain elements of the game, which i got from the internet.
Since this game is already found on the internet, this is more of my take on how this game works.
If any patrs of the game look like they have been copied, I hope you forgive me as i have not done it intentionally. This game is very popular and i have taken assets related to this game from the internet.
Hope you like it.
